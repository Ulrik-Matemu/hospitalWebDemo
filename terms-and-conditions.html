            <h2>Risks of using Website Services</h2>
            <p>As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with using our Services, including but not limited to:</p>
            <p>In an online Consultation, the physician will not be examining you physically. Whether at an in-person Consultation or online, the medical expert may not have access to some or all of your medical history. During an online Consultation, the medical expert will not have the benefit of information obtained by examining you in person, observing your physical condition or going through your medical records. The medical expert may not be aware of facts that affect his or her opinion on your diagnosis or treatment. Service provided online are therefore different from the diagnostic and treatment services typically offered by a physician. To reduce the risk of this limitation, Siha polyclinic strongly encourages you to visit a physician in person.</p>
            <p>By requesting a medical opinion through this Website, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
            <p>The advice, information or opinion on diagnosis you receive can be limited and provisional;</p>
            <p>The medical opinion is not intended to replace an in-person Consultation;</p>
            <p>In case of a second opinion where there is a difference of opinion among medical experts, you bear the responsibility to decide on an online or in-person Consultation, procedure and/or treatment;</p>
            <p>The medical expert relies on the information you provide, and any information demonstrated to have been falsified, misleading or incomplete will immediately render the opinion and all details therein null and void;</p>
            <p>The medical expert may determine that the information you provide is inadequate and may ask for more information, without which he or she may refuse to answer your queries or state an opinion;</p>
            <p>The medical expert may determine that a medical opinion may not be possible without a physical examination, and may refuse the Consultation forthwith;</p>
            <p>Online security protocols may fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information; and</p>
            <p>Delays in medical evaluation and answers may occur due to deficiencies or failures of the Service as mentioned in these Terms of Service.</p>
